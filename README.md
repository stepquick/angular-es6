# AngularJS ES6 built using Webpack
[Demo](http://stepquick.net/angularjs-es6/)

Built using best practices outlined on [Todd Motto's ES6/ES2015 Style guide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide).

Used webpack configurations for production and live reloading in development. Please read package.json for more information.

``npm start`` will run webpack-dev-server and load in the browser at http://localhost:8080
