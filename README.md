Angular 1.5 ES6 with Webpack

This is a clean slate for me to learn more about component-styled angularJS development. Will apply towards learning more for ng2 as well.

Some code has been used from [Angular JS 1.5 - ES6 Module Unit testing and Karma Integration testing](https://github.com/tomastrajan/angular-js-es6-testing-example) by [@tomastrajan](https://twitter.com/tomastrajan):

It was the best example of close the coding style I wanted to use for angular. Not only es6, but it's fairly vanilla. However the build process is different, and uses webpack configs similar to this project: [Angular2 Webpack Starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)

Plans for this project:
** Learn more about ES6
** Continue learning new ways to leverage 1.5 angular components until ng2 becomes more stable
** Learn more about typescript, I may combine into this project when I find out more about typings and its loader.
